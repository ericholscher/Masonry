A very basic IRC bot written in Perl.

Depends on:

    POE
    POE::Component::IRC
    POE::Component::Server::TCP

These can be installed with cpan, or from apt, which is what I've usually done.

apt-get install libpoe-component-irc-perl
apt-get install libtest-poe-server-tcp-perl

The client depends on Net::Telnet:

apt-get install libnet-telnet-perl
